# Customer Review Analysis with BERT

This project applies deep learning (BERT) to classify the sentiment of customer reviews as positive or negative. It demonstrates the use of transformer models in natural language processing (NLP) to derive insight from unstructured text data.

## Overview

- **Goal:** Classify customer reviews into positive or negative sentiment
- **Model:** Fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **Dataset:** Text-based customer reviews from a public eCommerce dataset
- **Result:** Achieved high F1 score and strong validation accuracy
- **Business Impact:** Enables automated feedback analysis to improve customer satisfaction

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Transformers (HuggingFace)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
